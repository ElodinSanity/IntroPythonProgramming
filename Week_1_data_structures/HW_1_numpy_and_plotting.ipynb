    "We have the full data set, a way to filter it, and the ability to calculate RMS for a given data channel. Let's combine these abilities and graph the left hand and right hand accelerometer RMS for a single clap, snap, and high five. After that, we can take a step back and observe how the graph differs between motion types."
