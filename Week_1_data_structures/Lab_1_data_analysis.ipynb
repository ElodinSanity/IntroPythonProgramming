    "## Lab 1: Introduction to manipulating data with numpy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Motivation**: Whether you're in engineering or business or health care - almost any field nowadays - you need to be able to work with data. Just about every thing that touches a computer now has the ability to store data. Most of this data will be numbers, but sometimes it will be qualitative data (think 3 people like this, 10 people don't).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do a lot of data analysis with spreadsheets, but at some point it's almost always easier to write some code to either *put* data into a spreadsheet in a form that's useful, to *pull* specific data from one (or more) spreadsheets, or to automate some processes (like creating six custom plots from this month's data showing price trends). Being able to write a bit of code to clean up or re-purpose data is really useful, and not too difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lab week 1: Read in data, re-arrange it, and use it to do (text-based) statistical analysis\n",
    "- Lab week 2: Same thing again, but this time with functions so you can re-use code\n",
    "- Lab week 3: Plot the data you worked with in labs week 1 & 2\n",
    "- Homework weeks 1, 2 & 3: \n",
    "-- Make the code more general, so you can look at different data channels\n",
    "-- Make nicer plots\n",
    "\n",
    "Some notes on the data you'll be working with. This is real data captured by sensors on human hands engaged in hand-clapping game activities. Each hand has an accelerometer and a gyroscope. Each file contains a data stream from these sensors from a specific human subject (S1, S2, etc) engaged in a particular motion (F for \"high-five\", S for \"snap\", C for \"clap\"). For example, `S10F6.csv` is subject 10 performing a high-five for the 6th time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Big picture: We want to know if someone is performing a high-five, snap, or clap based on this sensor data.** Each row of each CSV file is data from a single point in time. Each column is a data point from a sensor at this point in time. We want to plot/analyze data from different motions and see if there is a difference between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab the goal is to pull out one data channel from one subject (the right hand accelerometer) and print out statistics for different motions. Yes, you could do all of this by manually going into the spreadsheet and setting up some spreadsheet formulas. That works for one data channel... but what if you want to do a different one? Or the data file format changes because someone added another sensor? Or you're asked to throw out the biggest n samples?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, this is going to be frustrating/seem like a lot of work for nothing the first time you do it. The point is not\n",
    "to do this particular task, but to learn how to access data in dictionaries, lists, and numpy arrays to \"pull out\"\n",
    "data that you're interested in.\n",
